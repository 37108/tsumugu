# tsumugu-build

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 91060dc: The sidebar disclosure starts closed on narrow screens (the wide layout is
  unaffected), `tsumugu build` reports the size of what it wrote, and front
  matter keys one slip away from a known key — `hiden`, `titel` — get a warning
  naming the key they were probably reaching for.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [91060dc]
- Updated dependencies [d71e12b]
- Updated dependencies [42d86f2]
  - tsumugu-core@0.2.0

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- a06ff82: First pre-alpha release.

  `tsumugu dev` serves a directory of Markdown and HTML files with navigation, a
  table of contents, heading anchors, syntax highlighting, search, static assets,
  generated landing and error pages, and watch-driven rebuilds with live reload.
  `tsumugu build` writes the same site to a directory with clean URLs.

  Nothing here is a stable API. While the version starts with `0.`, any release
  may change anything: see `docs/releasing.md`.
