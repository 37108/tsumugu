# tsumugu-core

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 91060dc: The sidebar disclosure starts closed on narrow screens (the wide layout is
  unaffected), `tsumugu build` reports the size of what it wrote, and front
  matter keys one slip away from a known key — `hiden`, `titel` — get a warning
  naming the key they were probably reaching for.
- 42d86f2: The table of contents marks the section being read. The page client sets
  `aria-current="location"` on the entry whose heading last crossed the reading
  line, throttled to one frame; the stylesheet draws the same indigo thread the
  sidebar uses for the current page.

### Patch Changes

- d71e12b: The shell and theme stylesheets are now authored in Tailwind and compiled at
  build time into the same inline stylesheets that always shipped. No runtime
  change: same selectors, same palette, same content-security policy, zero
  client dependencies.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- a06ff82: First pre-alpha release.

  `tsumugu dev` serves a directory of Markdown and HTML files with navigation, a
  table of contents, heading anchors, syntax highlighting, search, static assets,
  generated landing and error pages, and watch-driven rebuilds with live reload.
  `tsumugu build` writes the same site to a directory with clean URLs.

  Nothing here is a stable API. While the version starts with `0.`, any release
  may change anything: see `docs/releasing.md`.
